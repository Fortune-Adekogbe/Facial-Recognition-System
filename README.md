# Facial Recognition System

This project contains the code for a facial recognition system.
This system was built with the aid of [Deepnote's](https://deepnote.com/) long-running
notebooks ande [Anvil's](https://anvil.works/) Python and drag and drop based user
interface. 

The sample scenario was the admin panel of a
visitor verification system at the entrance of the Umbrella 
Academy. This is based on the relatively popular TV show with
the same title.

The primary goal is to demonstrate that data scientists can 
easily connect the methods in their notebooks to a live 
interface regardless without the use of a backend framework
or a frontend technologies.
